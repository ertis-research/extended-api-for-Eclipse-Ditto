# Extended API for Eclipse Ditto

This component is an important part of the [OpenTwins](https://github.com/ertis-research/OpenTwins) platform and functions as an upper layer to the API provided by the [Eclipse Ditto](https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto) digital twin framework. Its objective is to improve the **compositionality** and **reusability** of digital twins. To this end, this module introduces a differentiation between two distinct kinds of things (twins and types) and imposes restrictions on the management of these things to ensure compliance with a defined set of requirements.
